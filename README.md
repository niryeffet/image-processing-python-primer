# image-processing-python-primer
A repository with very basic image processing tools in Python.
The Jupyter Notebook computes and displays various processing algorithms on an image captured with a webcam. 
Processing is done mainly using OpenCV. 
The processing includes:
Capturing photo with webcam
Decomposing to R,G,B values
Converting to grayscale
Face and eye detection
Blurring
Sharpening
Denoising
Edge detection
Calculating the histogram

To make things easier, I've added a script to run Jupyter notebooks from a virtual invironment.
If any library is missing, it will install it first.
Here are the instructions:
1. Download the project and unzip.
2. In the terminal, go to the unzipped dir.
3. ./run.sh (creates the virtual environment and installs the needed python libraries with pip).
4. Jupyter notebook should open up
5. open the notebook called Fun project with OpenCV

This works with mac, it might also work on Linux.
If you use Windows, please install Jupyter and the libraries listed in requirements.txt
